        Saftey Advice
      </h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Online dating gives you a wider scope of choice and can be a safer
          experience than traditional dating in that you can remain at a
          distance until you are ready to meet. But there are risks! You don’t
          really know the person behind the profile until you have got to know
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide has been put together to help ensure your experience with
          online dating is as safe and enjoyable as possible.
        </p>

          Although we screen every new profile prior to publishing them, we do
          not conduct background checks on members of this Website. We urge all
          members to apply great wisdom and care whilst communicating and
          meeting people on this Website. No matter how desperate you are to
          meet that special someone, your personal safety should be your No. 1
          priority. Remember, no matter how hard we work to keep you safe, it is
          ultimately your responsibility to stay aware, use your own instincts
          and apply common sense both online and offline. Importantly, as
          Christians, prayer is always the master key. Pray about your future
          partner and ask God to guide you to meet them.

          <li>
            Keep communication online until you get to know the person well and
            you are comfortable to take things offline. We offer you video chat
            and messaging services as a secure and safe way to help you to get
            to know people. Scammers will try to get you away from the safety of
            our dating platform as soon as possible. Be wary of anyone who
            presses you to do this too quickly. Do not yield to their pressure.
            If necessary, report the profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an online contact provides a link to chat on a different site, or
            they immediately try to pressure you into chatting via a different
            app or meeting up in person, that’s a warning sign. Stop all contact
            and if necessary, report the profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your personal information private (e. g. your last name, email,
            phone number, addresses or other identifying information) until you
            feel 100% comfortable sharing it with your match.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you post a photo, make sure that no one can identify your
            family, friends, home, car etc init.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treat people online as you would if meeting in person by asking
            questions and taking your time. Go at your pace and do not yield to
            pressure. Creating a meaningful, long-lasting relationship should be
            a marathon not a sprint. Slow and steady wins the race.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trust your own instincts. If something doesn't feel right, why take
            a chance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Getting to know someone requires curiosity, a little digging, and a
            lot of common sense. Do not be afraid or shy to ask your potential
            partner any question. The questions you do not ask are the answers
            you do not get. That’s the best way to discover an ideal match and
            ultimately find lasting love.
          </li>
          <li>
            We work hard to moderate profiles; however, it is always worth
            researching your online partner. Do a web search and look up your
            potential partner on various social media platforms to see if their
            details, images and stories match.
          </li>
          <li>
            Get to know someone well before agreeing to meet them offline by
            using our messaging and video chatting features to see if they seem
            genuine and if there is chemistry! Ask a lot of questions and watch
            for potential inconsistencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you feel it’s time to meet offline, no matter how much you
            trust your match, make sure that the first few dates are in a
            neutral public location that is easily accessible to you and is
            within view and hearing distance of other people like coffee shop,
            restaurant, etc. If your date pressures you to meet at their house
            or at an isolated place, please cancel the date.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should also arrange your own transportation to and from the
            dates. Do not accept a pick up or drop off by your date.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever you are meeting with someone you have met online, make sure
            that you have informed at least one close friend or relative of your
            whereabouts and ensure that the person you are meeting is aware that
            other people know about your meeting with them. Be wary of someone
            who asks you not to tell anyone about them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrange with someone to ‘check in' at regular intervals and have a
            coded way of telling them how your date is going, especially if you
            need help.
          </li>
          <li>
            During a date, make sure your phone, purse and drinks are always
            kept within your eyesight. Make sure your phone is fully charged and
            is able to make contact with others. If you think your food or drink
            has been tampered with, don't consume it. Do not take a chance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trust your instincts. If you think something is wrong, you should
            politely make an excuse and leave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never share your financial information or send money to someone you
            met online, even if you feel you’ve got to know them, no matter how
            nicely they ask or sound, and no matter how sad or urgent their
            story. If someone asks you for money, even if you have built up a
            trusting rapport with them, they are almost certainly a scammer. If
            someone requests money or you sense a scam, report their profile
            immediately. Our customer service team will investigate this. We are
            always ready and waiting to help — that’s part of our commitment to
            you!
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not let anyone you met online pressure you into intimacy. Go at
            your own pace. Make sure you are sober and in full control at all
            times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be cautious if the relationship progresses more quickly than you are
            used to. Sudden declarations of undying love are intended to play on
            your emotions in the hope that you will drop your guard.
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone is harassing you or seems like a fraudulent profile,
            report it immediately. We will look into it and take appropriate
            actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            We would also like you to report any bad dates or violent incidents
            to us, so that we can take the appropriate action.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that your log-in details are kept safe and secure. The use
            of a strong password is essential in order to protect your security
            and identity online. Your password must be strong and not easily
            guessed. E. g. avoid using obvious passwords such as your personal
            information or things that can be easily identified with you.
            Passwords must be completely unique, and not used for any other
            system, application, or personal account. Passwords should not be
            shared with anyone, should not be revealed or sent electronically
            and should not be written down or physically stored.
          </li>
          <li>
            When accessing your account from a public or shared computer, use
            caution and be aware of your surroundings so that others are not
            able to view or record your password or other personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be aware of links that lead to web pages which look similar or
            identical to the Christian Dating and Social Networking website,
            including its log-in fields. These links are typically sent as
            attempts to “phish” for log-in information from users in order to
            compromise user accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, think about what you share online. Once you’ve shared it
            you cannot take it back!
          </li>
