          Who We Are
        </h4>
        <p>
          Christian Dating and Social Networking was the vision of Ebere Nneji.
          She realised that it has become increasingly difficult to meet people
          who are genuine Christians and serious about their faith, in an ever
          more secular world, and this is even more challenging on online
          platforms be it for dating, socials or other purposes. Her passion for
          seeing people form God-centered relationships and to see Christian
          marriages form and blossom led to the development of Christian Dating
          and Social Networking. She also wanted it to be more than just a
          dating site, but to be a place of community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right from the days of Adam and Eve, to the days of our grandparents
          and parents, and to present day, life has changed a lot; and so has
          the way we meet people, including that special someone. The internet
          has increasingly become the go-to-place for almost all of life’s needs
          including finding love. It is therefore no surprise that online dating
          websites are all over the internet nowadays and more and more are
          springing up day by day. As the scene becomes more proliferated so are
          the security failures involving fraudulent behaviours and scams that
          have affected a lot of innocent users of online dating websites. There
          are now so many bogus sites which consist of a deluge of fake
          profiles, non-Christians and scammers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian Dating and Social Networking is an online platform that is
          built to provide a safe place for genuine Christians to meet other
          like-minded Christian singles for real meaningful relationships,
          potentially leading to marriage. At Christian Dating and Social
          Networking, safety is at the heart of everything we do. We take fake
          profiles and scammers seriously, making us one of the safest dating
          websites of our time. We do not buy profiles from other websites. All
          profiles on our website are screened by us prior to publishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to also empower, inspire and encourage single
          Christians in their faith and day-to-day lives whether or not they are
          actively looking for a partner. We have very active and lively
          discussion boards and a system that allows members to organise local
          meetup activities. We also organise offline corporate events to give
          people a chance to meet face to face in a safe and comfortable
          environment. Our corporate events cover a range of themes including
          seminars, conferences, retreats, get-aways, music festivals, films,
          theatres, comedy nights etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst we are not a match-making or marriage advice agency, we hope we
          have provided a platform that will empower you to take the right steps
          in order to find that special someone and/or improve yourself with our
          range of meetups and events whilst you are searching.
