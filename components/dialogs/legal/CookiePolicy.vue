            What Are Cookies and Related Technologies
          </h4>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are downloaded on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website or app. Your web browser then
            sends these cookies back to the website or app on each subsequent
            visit so that they can recognise you and remember things like
            personalised details or user preferences. Cookies are very useful
            and do lots of different jobs which help to make your experience on
            websites as smooth as possible. For example, they let you move
            between web pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and
            generally improving your experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their
            websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide
            reporting information. The Cookies that we use allow us and our
            third-party partners and providers to collect certain information
            about your interactions with our email communications, websites and
            other online services. We and our third-party partners and providers
            may also use other related technologies to collect this information,
            such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying
            technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “cookies”).
